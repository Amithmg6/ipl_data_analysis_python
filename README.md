# IPL Data analysis

The project focuses on building data science skills using python.
Advancements in data science has lead to many new ways of using data
for data viz, data analytics, exploratory analytics, predective analytics,
regression, classification, clustering, modeling, time series, machine learning,
deep learning, artificial intelligence and more...

Python is used extensively in this repo to build everything.
From reading a simple csv file to getting data from SQL db.

Hadoop conectivity will also be attempted in this repo.

*The entire project is built on my understanding of
 1. Data Science,
 2. Statistics,
 3. Bigdata,
 4. Machine Learning and AI
